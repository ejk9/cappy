### Tools Required 

* Computer with Node and git
  * We have primarily tested it with the current node LTS version - 16.13.1. We have found that running it on version 10.12.0 proved to be incompatible with testing and running with React.
* Browser

### Installation

Installing the repo running:

Open a terminal in VSCODE, Powershell, command prompt, or whatever the operating system runs off of. The installation of git and node are not covered here, feel free to look it up for your system.

`$ git clone https://github.com/ejk9/cappy.git` (omitting the $ when running locally)

`$ cd cappy`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

This will automatically open a browser with a version of the website up

## Deployment 

The demo version is deployed using Firebase hosting.

Other tools that can be used to deploy is hosting websites, Amazon AWS services, Heroku, running an instance of the webserver on a computer using Linode, etc.
